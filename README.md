### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Luqman Haqeem
I'm a software engineer based in Ara Damansara, Selangor, Malaysia, with a passion for programming and a strong focus on attention to detail. I love exploring new technologies and constantly expanding my skill set. PHP is my go-to language, and I feel most comfortable using CodeIgniter as my preferred framework. However, I've also worked on several projects using Laravel. I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on innovative projects and delivering high-quality solutions.

Skills: PHP / JS / HTML / CSS
